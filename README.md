# Fedora - SmartDisplay

Setup of my SmartDisplay, based on Fedora Linux.

## Motivation

I wanted to work with Kiosk mode machines a long time now and this little
Smart Display project is meant to learn about the options and document my work.

## Description

A Smart Display can be useful for all kind of stuff. The below list is meant
as "ideas" to use a smart display:

- Smart Mirror
- Informational display on the desk
- display something on a conference TV / office TV

To bring this stuff to live, I wanted to have a general solution, based on
tools I already know. I came up with a basic idea of:

- Fedora as the operating system
- GNOME Kiosk to ensure a graphical session
- Cockpit Project for graphical remote management
- Ansible to automate everything
- More tools, depending on the use case
